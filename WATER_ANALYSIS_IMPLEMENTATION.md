## 📊 DATA VERIFICATION

### **Excluded Meters Confirmed**
```
❌ 4300336 - Community Mgmt - Technical Zone, STP
❌ 4300338 - PHASE 02, MAIN ENTRANCE Infrastructure

✅ VERIFICATION METHOD:
1. Search for "4300336" → No results
2. Search for "4300338" → No results  
3. Data processing excludes these during CSV integration
4. UI shows confirmation of exclusions
```

### **Zone Bulk Priority**
```
🏗️ Zone Bulk Meters Prioritized:
- Zone FM: 4300346 (26,857 m³ total)
- Zone 3A: 4300343 (47,333 m³ total) 
- Zone 8: 4300342 (45,303 m³ total)
- Village Square: 4300335 (4,960 m³ total)

📈 Individual Zone Meters:
- All residential, retail, and building meters included
- Parent-child relationships maintained
- Type classification preserved (Villa/Apartment/Retail/etc.)
```
